# A **better** SOE Templateâ„¢ #

The default template for server object extensions from esri is _pretty_ bad. I wasn't very happy with it so I modified it. 

1. Automatic endpoint discovery
2. Comments and method documentation!
3. Separated the logic into multiple classes 
 - I really don't like single class applications. This isn't VBA right?
4. Command Pattern Implementation
